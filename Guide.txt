A5. `df[df == 0].count()` gives count of zeros column-wise.

Q6. What is the difference between `.loc` and `.iloc`?
A6. `.loc[]` is label-based; `.iloc[]` is index-based.

Q7. How to count unique values in a column?
A7. Use `df['column'].nunique()` or `value_counts()`.

A8. Use `df.sort_values(by='column_name', ascending=True/False)`

Assignment 2: Summary Stats, Cleaning & Classification
-------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Compute summary statistics, clean data, transform it, and build a classification model.

Key Concepts:
- Descriptive stats: `mean()`, `std()`, `var()`, `describe()`
- Visualization: Histogram

Q2. How do you clean a dataset?
A2. Handling missing values (drop/fill), removing duplicates.

Q3. What is normalization and when do you use it?
A3. Scaling data between 0 and 1. Use when features have different units.

Q4. What classifier did you use and why?
A4. Example: Decision Tree – interpretable, handles both types of data.

Q5. How did you prepare the data for modeling?
A5. Filled missing values, encoded categorical data, used train-test split.

Q6. What is the use of `train_test_split`?
A6. To divide data into training and testing sets. From `sklearn.model_selection`.

Assignment 3: Data Visualization
--------------------------------
Objective:
Plot different graphs like scatter, bar, box, pie, and line charts for data analysis.

Key Concepts:
- Scatter plot: `plt.scatter(x, y)`
- Bar chart: `plt.bar()`
- Box plot: `sns.boxplot()`
- Pie chart: `plt.pie()`
- Line chart: `plt.plot()`

Viva Questions:
Q1. What is the use of scatter plot?
A1. To visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.

Q2. Difference between histogram and bar chart?
A2. Histogram: bins of numeric data. Bar chart: categories.

Q3. What is shown in a box plot?
A3. Distribution summary: median, IQR, outliers.

Q4. What libraries are used for visualization?
A4. `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas` (basic plots)

Q5. How do you interpret a pie chart?
A5. Used for displaying proportion of categories in a whole.

Q6. How to customize plots?
A6. Use `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`, `plt.legend()`

Assignment 4: Classification + Confusion Matrix
-----------------------------------------------
Objective:
Apply classification to predict customer response. Evaluate using confusion matrix.

Key Concepts:
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Classification Algorithms

Viva Questions:
Q1. What is a confusion matrix?
A1. A table showing TP, TN, FP, FN from predictions.

Q2. Define Accuracy.
A2. Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total predictions.

Q3. Define Precision and Recall.
A3. 
    Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
    Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

Q4. What is the F1 Score?
A4. Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall:
    F1 = 2 * (P * R) / (P + R)

Q5. Which algorithm was used?
A5. Example: Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.

Q6. What is the impact of class imbalance?
A6. Accuracy might be misleading. Use precision/recall or F1 score.

Assignment 5: Clustering on Mall Customer Data
----------------------------------------------
Objective:
Apply clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical) to segment mall customers based on spending score.

Key Concepts:
- Clustering (unsupervised)
- Elbow method
- Silhouette score (optional)
- KMeans, Agglomerative

Viva Questions:
Q1. What is KMeans Clustering?
A1. Algorithm that partitions data into K groups based on distance to centroid.

Q2. How do you determine the best K?
A2. Use Elbow Method (plot inertia vs K).

Q3. Difference between KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering?
A3. KMeans: flat partition. Hierarchical: tree-like clusters.

Q4. What preprocessing is done before clustering?
A4. Scaling, normalization, handling missing values.

Q5. What is inertia in KMeans?
A5. Sum of squared distances between samples and their cluster centroid.

- Regression line visualization

Viva Questions:
Q1. What is Linear Regression?
A1. A model that fits a line through data points to predict a continuous variable.

Q2. What is the difference between MAE and MSE?
A2. MAE: average absolute error. MSE: average of squared errors.

Q3. What is R² score?
A3. Proportion of variance in dependent variable explained by the model.

Q4. How do you visualize the regression model?
